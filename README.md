# Image-Segmentation-for-Self-Driving-Cars

## Overview
This project focuses on image segmentation for self-driving cars using the U-Net architecture. The U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed for image segmentation tasks, making it suitable for identifying and localizing objects in real-time. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images containing various objects relevant to autonomous driving, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs. The goal is to develop a robust model to segment different features of the road to enhance the safety and performance of self-driving cars.

## Workflow

### Data Collection: 
Obtain a dataset of labeled images with annotations for objects of interest (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs) relevant to self-driving cars.

### Data Pre-processing:
Resize images to a consistent resolution suitable for model input.
Normalize pixel values to a standardized range (e.g., 0 to 1).
Augment the dataset using techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to improve model generalization.

### Data Augmentation:
Apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and random cropping to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve model robustness.

### Model Training: 
Train the U-Net model using the augmented training dataset.

### Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Mean Average Precision (mAP) on a validation dataset.

## Model Architecture
The U-Net architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections. It efficiently captures both local and global features, making it suitable for image segmentation tasks like object detection.
